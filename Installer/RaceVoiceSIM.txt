This version of RaceVoiceStudio now carries the beta release of "RaceVoiceSIM"

In order to use it,Select the "iRacing PC Mode" from the ecu/dash and the PC should listen to the
available iRacing telemetry stream on your PC when you are using iRacing.

Set the track, segments, etc in RaceVoiceStudio as you normally would with your physical RaceVoice unit.
Press the "Update iRacing" button (lower left) to push any setup changes so they will be announced/etc. 
It may take 1 lap for all announcements to kick in.

This software also has a new feature called "Speech Tags"
You can right click on the track and press the "Add Speech Tag" option
This will pop-up a dialog box that will ask you for a name and phrase.
The idea behind the "speech tags" is that you can associate a user configurable phrase with a point on the track.
So if you want to remind yourself to breath/brush-brake/look-for-a-marker/etc - you can now do this with RaceVoice.
The speech tags will appear on the right side of the screen in the "Speech Tags" box. You can enable/disable each
speed tag with the checkbox next to each one. The speech tags will also be available in the physical RaceVoice unit shortly.
They function currently under iRacing if you want to experiment with them.

One note, you may have to use the Windows Audio Mixer (type "sound mixer") in your windows search box.
You may need to reduce the volume of the iRacing software and leave the "system sounds" at 100.
This is basically to just adjust the balance of the speech synthesis and the iRacing sounds.
Once you get the balance correct, you can then turn your PC's speakers up as loud as you want.

* Remember * this is beta software. Its been run on several PC's but if you see a bug/crash/odd-screen-message/etc
Please take a screen shot of it and email it to steve@racevoice.com

Let me know how it goes and what you think/etc of how this is working.

Thanks!
